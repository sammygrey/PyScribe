        Spawns a thread to repeatedly record phrases from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance and call ``callback`` with that ``AudioData`` instance as soon as each phrase are detected.

        Returns a function object that, when called, requests that the background listener thread stop. The background thread is a daemon and will not stop the program from exiting if there are no other non-daemon threads. The function accepts one parameter, ``wait_for_stop``: if truthy, the function will wait for the background listener to stop before returning, otherwise it will return immediately and the background listener thread might still be running for a second or two afterwards. Additionally, if you are using a truthy value for ``wait_for_stop``, you must call the function from the same thread you originally called ``listen_in_background`` from.

        Phrase recognition uses the exact same mechanism as ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``. The ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter works in the same way as the ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter for ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``, as well.

        The ``callback`` parameter is a function that should accept two parameters - the ``recognizer_instance``, and an ``AudioData`` instance representing the captured audio. Note that ``callback`` function will be called from a non-main thread.
