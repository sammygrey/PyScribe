    Creates a new ``Microphone`` instance, which represents a physical microphone on the computer. Subclass of ``AudioSource``.

    This will throw an ``AttributeError`` if you don't have PyAudio (0.2.11 or later) installed.

    If ``device_index`` is unspecified or ``None``, the default microphone is used as the audio source. Otherwise, ``device_index`` should be the index of the device to use for audio input.

    A device index is an integer between 0 and ``pyaudio.get_device_count() - 1`` (assume we have used ``import pyaudio`` beforehand) inclusive. It represents an audio device such as a microphone or speaker. See the `PyAudio documentation <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/>`__ for more details.

    The microphone audio is recorded in chunks of ``chunk_size`` samples, at a rate of ``sample_rate`` samples per second (Hertz). If not specified, the value of ``sample_rate`` is determined automatically from the system's microphone settings.

    Higher ``sample_rate`` values result in better audio quality, but also more bandwidth (and therefore, slower recognition). Additionally, some CPUs, such as those in older Raspberry Pi models, can't keep up if this value is too high.

    Higher ``chunk_size`` values help avoid triggering on rapidly changing ambient noise, but also makes detection less sensitive. This value, generally, should be left at its default.

        Records a single phrase from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance, which it returns.

The first yielded ``AudioData`` instance represents the first buffer of the phrase, and the last yielded ``AudioData`` instance represents the last buffer of the phrase. If ``stream`` is ``False``, the method will return a single ``AudioData`` instance representing the entire phrase.

        Spawns a thread to repeatedly record phrases from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance and call ``callback`` with that ``AudioData`` instance as soon as each phrase are detected.

        Returns a function object that, when called, requests that the background listener thread stop. The background thread is a daemon and will not stop the program from exiting if there are no other non-daemon threads. The function accepts one parameter, ``wait_for_stop``: if truthy, the function will wait for the background listener to stop before returning, otherwise it will return immediately and the background listener thread might still be running for a second or two afterwards. Additionally, if you are using a truthy value for ``wait_for_stop``, you must call the function from the same thread you originally called ``listen_in_background`` from.

        Phrase recognition uses the exact same mechanism as ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``. The ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter works in the same way as the ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter for ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``, as well.

        The ``callback`` parameter is a function that should accept two parameters - the ``recognizer_instance``, and an ``AudioData`` instance representing the captured audio. Note that ``callback`` function will be called from a non-main thread.
